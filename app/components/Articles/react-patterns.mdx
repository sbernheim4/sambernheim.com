# React Component and Hook Design Pattern
#### Published on Jan 14, 2025

I've noticed a common and exceptionally useful pattern in React - a composition
between a component and a purpose specific associated hook.

## Building a Select Form

An example to demonstrate this with a select element that we'll continue building up.

Let's start here:

~~~tsx
type Option = {
	displayName: string
	value: stirng;
};

type Options = Array<Option>;

const heros: Options = [
	{ displayName: 'Batman' value: 'batman', },
	{ displayName: 'Robin', value: 'robin' },
	{ displayName: 'Green Lantern', value: 'green-lantern' },
	// ...
];

const MyForm = () => {

	const [selected, setSelected] = useState(options.at(0))

	const handleChange = (e) => {
		const newSelected = e.target.value
		const match = heros.find(x => x.value === newSelected);
		setSelected(match.value);
	};

	const submit = () => {
		console.log(selected);
	};

	<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
		<select value={selected.value} onChange={handleChange}>
			{
				heros.map(hero => <option value={hero.value}>{hero.displayName}</option>)
			}
		</select>
	</form>

}
~~~

The state management for any `select` element is nearly always the same. We can
abstract it into a nice hook called `useOptions`. The goal of the hook is to be
used in the component that renders the `select` element and expose the currently
selected value along with a change handler function.

## Building the Hook

The hook needs to expose the `selected` value and the `handleChange` function:

~~~tsx
export const useOptions = (options: Options) => {
	const [selected, setSelected] = useState(options.at(0));

	const handleChange = (e) => {
		const newSelected = e.target.value
		const match = heros.find(x => x.value === newSelected);
		setSelected(match);
	};

	return [selected, handleChange] as const;
};
~~~

Great. Updating the form component to use the hook is easy and simplifies some
code:

~~~tsx
export const MyForm = () => {

	const [selected, handleChange] = useOptions(heros.at(0));

	const submit = () => {
		console.log(selected);
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<select value={selected.value} onChange={handleChange}>
				{
					heros.map(hero => <option value={hero.value}>{hero.displayName}</option>)
				}
			</select>
		</form>
	);

};
~~~

## Building the Component

We could end there and be content... but why stop. In the example above, the
props, `value` and `onChange`, are effectively fixed and we have a component
that is like a curried function that has been partially applied with those
props. That partial application can be formalized into a `ManagedSelect`
component:

~~~tsx
export const ManagedSelect = (props: { options: Options, ...selectProps }) => {

	const { options, ...selectProps } = props;

	const [selected, handleChange] = useOptions(heros);

	return (
		<select value={selected} onChange={handleChange} {...selectProps}>
			{
				options.map(opt => <option value={opt.value}>{opt.displayName}</option>)
			}
		</select>
	);
};
~~~

Using this in our form:

~~~tsx
export const MyForm = () => {

	const submit = () => {
		// ‚ùå We no longer have access to the `selected` value :(
		console.log(selected);
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<ManagedSelect options={heros} name="hero-selection" />
		</form>
	);
};
~~~

Better! But now we have lost access to the selected value in the `MyForm`
component. This works perfectly though for traditional forms that submit a POST
request with a `FormData` object to a server (or a Remix/React Router 7 `action`
function), but it won't work for forms that are highly dynamic with lots of
client side interactions and perform the form submission via a client side
function; the selected value needs to be exposed to the `MyForm` component for any
number of tasks. Some common examples are:

* Validation
* Derived state
* Passing the selected value to other components

## Marrying the Two

Its as if we want the `ManagedSelect` component to have 2 return values, the JSX
and the result of the `useOptions` hook the component invokes internally...

Included but not mentioned is the spreading of `selectProps`. This is the key
that enables a beautiful form of composition between the hook and component for
use in the parent component.

~~~tsx
export const MyForm = () => {

	const [selected, handleChange] = useOptions(heros);

	const submit = () => {
		console.log(selected);
	};

	return (
		<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
			<ManagedSelect value={selected} onChange={handleChange} options={heros} name="hero-selection" />
		</form>
	);
};
~~~

Now we have arrived at the beginning of the complete solution a Component and
associated Hook built for composition.

The props passed to `ManagedSelect` override the props set by the component
internally because `...selectProps` is spread at the end.

One downside to this implementation is the double invocation of `useOptions`,
first in `MyForm` and secondly internally in `ManagedSelect`. We can of course
continue to be clever and update `useOptions` to include a `skip` parameter
which the invocation in `ManagedSelect` can pass when it detects the `value` and
`onChange` props are passed directly. When that value is true the hook stops
execution and early returns. That is left as an exercise to the reader :).

## Closing Thoughts

I find this pattern cropping up frequently. A component needs some state
management that is common and repetitive in its use along with functions to act
on that state. The user of that component sometimes (but not always) needs
access to that state along with associated functions that have a closure around
that state.

This pattern is a perfect match for those situations.

The power of this is the component can manage itself or be controlled by its
props but in either case is managed by the same hook. Often we see this when a
hook with certain behaviors is tied to some type of UI - IE using the hook only
makes sense when using a specific component rather than being more general
purpose.
