# Log and Continue

We often write and modify code that looks like this

```this
const getApiResults = () => {

	const myArr = getApiResults();

	const normalizedApiResults = myArr.filter(filterFn)
		.map(mappingFn)
		.reduce(reducingFn)
		.sort(sortingFn);

	return normalizedApiResults;

};
```

We can condense this even further by either composing the three transformational
steps into a single `flatMap` invocation and pass through but I find the
readability of keeping each step separate helpful as per my [Debug Driven
Development](sambernheim.com/blog/debug-driven-development) methodology.

Often when coding we'll want to inspect the array between these steps. It's easy
enough to refactor the snippet storing each step's intermediate value in its own
variable, adding console logs between or debugger statements at each line.

```ts
const filteredData = myArr.filter(filterFn);
const transformedData = filteredData.map(mappingFn);
const reducedData = transformedData.reduce(reducingFn);
const sortedData = reducedData.sort(sortingFn);

console.log(sortedData);
```

Having to go through this refactoring just for a console log though is
frustrating. We can create a better world.

## Log And Continue
`logAndContinue` is the solution to realizing this better world. Here's the
code:

```ts
Array.prototype.logAndContinue = function() {
	console.log(this);
	return this;
}
```ts

A lot simpler than you were expecting right. Here's how we use it.

```ts
const myData = myArr.filter(filterFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.map(mappingFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.reduce(reducingFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.sort(sortingFn);
```

> INSERT IMAGE OR COPY RESULT TEXT AS CODE SNIPPET

We could decide to be done here - but where's the fun in that.

## Even Better Logging

What if we parameterize a logging string so that when the array is logged, a
prefix and postfix string is included around the array value:

```ts
Array.prototype.logAndContinue = function(prefixString, postfixString) {
	console.log(prefixString + this + postfixString);
	return this;
}
```

Now we can decorate the array logging with whatever strings we want:

```ts
const myData = myArr.filter(filterFn)
	.logAndContinue('Filtered Array:', 'fin')
	.map(mappingFn)
	.logAndContinue('Mapped Array', 'fin')
	.reduce(reducingFn)
	.logAndContinue('Reduced Array', 'fin')
	.sort(sortingFn);
```

> INSERT IMAGE OR COPY RESULT TEXT AS CODE SNIPPET

We have a bit more control and can log generally better but passing around
strings doesn't feel quite right. The most powerful control we can leverage
would be through some inversion of control. Instead of passing in a couple of
string values to `logAndContinue`, we can have it accept a function that
receives as its argument the array, and returns a string. By default this
function will return the array as a string.

## Maximum Logging
We can achieve maximal logging nirvana with the following implementation.

```ts
Array.prototype.logAndContinue = function(fn = (array) => array.toString()) {
	const array = this;
	const stringToLog = fn(array);
	console.log(stringToLog);
	return this;
}
```

I know, still very simple. We can continue using this array method minimally.

```ts
const myData = myArr.filter(filterFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.map(mappingFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.reduce(reducingFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.sort(sortingFn);
```

We can also functionalize the string that gets logged:

```ts
const arrayLoggerOne = (array) => {
	return 'After filtering the array value is ' + array.toString() + ' fin';
};

// Log only the first element of the array.
const arrayLoggerTwo = (array) => {
	return `The array has ${array.length} elements and after mapping, the first
value of the array is ${array[0].toString()}`;
};

const myData = myArr.filter(filterFn)
	.logAndContinue(arrayLoggerOne)
	.map(mappingFn)
	.logAndContinue(arrayLoggerTwo)
	.reduce(reducingFn)
	.logAndContinue()
	.sort(sortingFn);

```

This provides a lot of power to our logging capabilities for arrays through a
still easy to use interface.

##
With an `Array.logAndContinue` method, we get a far better debugging and array
helper method than we otherwise would. Is it always going to be the easiest way
to log arrays, no. But when we have a chain of array methods that we just want
to inspect, it becomes a lot easier to hop in and hop out with minimal
refactoring.
