# Cool Tools For Full Stack Development

Within the first couple of weeks of a job I was performing some basic (though new to me) database work. I hadn't interacted directly with databases professionally and the last time I did personally was my undergraduate databases class.

Despite this I got my changes done thanks to a some pair programming, googling, and lots of iterations. I merged my work and deployed the changes.

What was more interesting was learning how my team interacts with the database from our client application. It's not a REST API on top of the Database or a server that returns the result of a pre-written SQL statement. No, that would be too ordinary.

Instead we have a GraphQL API that proxies the entire Database. We achieve this with [Postgraphile](https://postgraphile.org).

Immediately I was hooked.

The ability to modify the database via SQL and have any and all those changes (functions, rules, user permissions, tables, relationships etc) transparently reflected in a GraphQL API is powerful.

Our front end application is a React app that interacts with GraphQL via [Apollo's hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/static-typing#usequery). Unfortunately, we have to type and write the hooks. And that is annoying:

```ts
type User = {
    name: string;
    age?: number;
    email?: string;
    // ...
}
const MyUserQuery: TypedDocumentNode<User> = gql`
query MyUsers {
    users {
        name
    }
}
`;
```

This feels silly - the GraphQL server already knows the types from the database schema. When manually writing these its also all too easy to incorrectly type a property as required when its really optional or forget that a column has been renamed.

But there's more than just types out in these waters. The real value is in automatically generating hooks to query our DB via GraphQL from `.gql` files.

So lets get to that!

The database is running on port `5432` in a docker container via docker-compose.

Another container will host the GraphQL API via Postgraphile. In a new folder at the root, create a `graphile.config.mjs` file:

```ts
import { PostGraphileAmberPreset } from "postgraphile/presets/amber";

const preset = {
	grafserv: {
		dangerouslyAllowAllCORSRequests: true,
	},
	extends: [PostGraphileAmberPreset],
};

export default preset;
```

and in a `Dockerfile` at the same location:


```bash
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install --production

COPY ./graphile.config.mjs ./graphile.config.mjs
```

We only need 2 npm packages:

`npm install --save graphql postgraphile`

Postgraphile runs on port `5678` and can be started with the command:

`"npx postgraphile --config graphile.config.mjs -c ${DATABASE_URL}"`

> DATABASE_URL is going to be something like: `postgresql://root:example@db:5432/mydatabase`. Store this in your .env file.

Update the `docker-compose` file with this new service:

```
  # PostgreSQL DB service above ...

  graphql-server:
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./postgraphile/presets:/app/presets
    build:
      context: ./postgraphile
    env_file:
      - .env
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - network
    ports:
      - 5433:5433
      - 5678:5678
    command:
      "npx postgraphile --config graphile.config.mjs -c ${DATABASE_URL}"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5678/graphql' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{\"query\":\"query Healthcheck { __typename }\",\"operationName\":\"Healthcheck\"}' || exit 1"]
      interval: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 30s
      timeout: 10s

```

Congrats - you now have a GraphQL API that fronts your entire DB. Visit `localhost:5678/graphql` to use the GraphiQL playground.

## Generating React Hooks
We want to generate types and hooks to use in our frontend application.

We can do this with [CodeGen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/getting-started).

Like everything good in the world, code generation is configuration driven via a file named `codegen.ts`

Point the generator at your GraphQL server - `localhost:5678/graphql` - and provide:

- Its inputs - our `.gql` files that contain the queries AND mutations we want
- Where to put the generated files - the hooks and types it will create
- The tools to use for the code generation

```ts
import type { CodegenConfig } from "@graphql-codegen/cli";

const config: CodegenConfig = {
    schema: "http://localhost:5678/graphql",
    documents: "./app/queries/**/*.gql",
    generates: {
        "./app/generated/gqlQueries.ts": {
            presetConfig: {
                gqlTagName: 'gql',
            },
            plugins: [
                "typescript",
                "typescript-resolvers",
                "typescript-operations",
                "typescript-react-apollo",
            ],
            config: {
                gqlImport: 'graphql-tag#gql',
                useTypeImports: true,
                fetcher: {
                    endpoint: "http://localhost:5678/graphql"
                }
            }
        },
    },
};

export default config;
```

I had trouble getting the `gql` function from Apollo working in the generated code, so I use the npm package `graphql-tag` instead and use the `config` section to specify that the `gql` function should come from this package. There was also an issue in how types were imported in the generated file. They were imported without the `type` keyword. So we configure the generator to import all types with that keyword.

The plugins section is the magic.

- typescript
- typescript-resolvers
- typescript-operations
- typescript-react-apollo

These packages transform the queries in our .gql files to hooks that use apollo-query. I tried using @tanstack/query too - but that was less successful.

These are the core NPM packages:

```bash
npm i --save-dev \
    @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/client-preset \
    @graphql-codegen/introspection \
    @graphql-codegen/schema-ast \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers
```

With a couple of new npm scripts to simplify our workflow, we're off.

```json
"gen": "rm -rf app/generated && graphql-codegen",
"gen:dev": "rm -rf app/generated && graphql-codegen --watch"
```

Our last and final step is to write a query in a `.gql` file in `app/queries/` for the generator to consume and create a hook.

Fire up your database and bring up the GraphQL wrapper (`docker-compose up`), and in a separate tab run either of the npm commands for your client application. You'll be rewarded with a file that contains the generated hook with all the type information matching your database.

Use it in one of your components and wait for the magic.

## Conclusion

We've bridged the gap between our backend and frontend. Our entire database is transparently and safely accessible via GraphQL through generated hooks that are fully and accurately typed from `.gql` files. The GraphQL server maintains all permission related controls on tables and rows, exposes SQL functions as GQL queries, indexes for look up by requests, types, and most everything else.

Postgraphile can be run as a [NodeJS server via Express to handle requests](https://postgraphile.org/postgraphile/next/usage-library). Inject any middleware you want before it serves the request.
